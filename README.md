# ViTCap-R: Vision Transformer-Based Image Captioning with Dual-Encoder Retrieval

ViTCap-R is a unified deep learning framework that combines image captioning and image-text retrieval. It integrates Vision Transformers, patch-level attention, and dual-encoder contrastive learning.

## 🚀 Features
- Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder
- Patch-level attention decoder (LSTM-based)
- Dual-encoder retrieval with contrastive InfoNCE loss
- Hard Negative Mining (HNM) support
- Qualitative visualizations (attention heatmaps, t-SNE, PCA)
- Evaluation with BLEU, METEOR, and Recall@K
